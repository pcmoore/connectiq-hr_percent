Connect IQ Heart Rate Percentage Data Field
===============================================================================
https://github.com/pcmoore/connectiq-hr_percent

This is a simple Connect IQ application which provides a heart rate as a
percentage of the user's maximum heart rate.  This data field is different
from the built-in data field on the Garmin fenix 3 as a "%" is included to
help distinguish it from other fields.
